<p><h3> The objective of this experiement</h1></p>
<pre>
When we browse the web or use web-based applications like maps, the network can Cause delays. This experiment explores how we perceive different delays for a map application. 
</pre>
<p><h3> A/B testing</h1></p>
<pre>
<img src="img/ab.png"><br/>
You will be asked to compare the time 2 maps took to load and to decide whether the second map was faster or slower in loading than the first.
- Once the two maps are loaded, user gives a feedback and declares which one was faster or slower.
- After the second map has loaded you can choose whether it was definitely slower or faster than the first on a 5-point scale like this: 

<img src="img/feedback.png"><br/>
- If you are not sure, just choose the ‘Not Sure’ option or the definitely faster/Definitely slower is you are very confident.
- Before the experiment you will get the opportunity to try two rounds of training samples so you know what to expect. These results will not be recorded.
- During the experiment you will be presented with 50 map pairs. It will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. 
- You can choose to stop participating and exit at any time.
